Author: Lauren Harris & Sarah Lam & Deanna Elliott
Maintainer: Lauren Harris <lnharris@bren.ucsb.edu>
Description: This package contains a function (lyric_analysis.R) which takes in a musical artist's name and returns the song names and sentiment values (using sentiment analysis libraries "GI" or "QDAP") for all of that artist's Billboard Top 100 hits. Output sentiment values range from -1 (negative sentiment) to 1 (positive sentiment). The dataframe of musical artists (all_artists.rda) contains artist names from the years 1960 to 2016. This dataset is included so that users can view the possible artists to use as inputs for the function.
